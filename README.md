# Aura Reader for two

Uses [Daily](https://daily.co), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and the chemistry between you and someone you care about. Based on the solo version of this project, [aura-reader-2020](https://github.com/ablwr/aura-reader-2020).

## Running locally

To run locally, you'll need to copy `.env.example` from the root directory to `.env` and fill out the required fields, which are a [Daily](https://www.daily.co/) domain and API key (you can get them from that link).

Then, you know, the usual:

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

Assuming all goes well, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

**N.B.: I know we are long past the era of "Best viewed in X browser", but the experience truly is more visually appealing when using Firefox due to how it handles the rendering of partially transparent gradient**
