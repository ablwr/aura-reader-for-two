# [Aura Reader for two](https://aura-reader-for-two.vercel.app/)
by [Ashley Blewer](https://ashleyblewer.com)


Uses [Daily](https://daily.co), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and the chemistry between you and someone you care about. 

Based on the solo version of this project, [aura-reader-2020](https://github.com/ablwr/aura-reader-2020).

## Running locally

To run locally, you'll need to copy `.env.example` from the root directory to `.env` and fill out the required fields, which are a [Daily](https://www.daily.co/) domain and API key (you can get them from that link).

Then, you know, the usual:

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

Assuming all goes well, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
